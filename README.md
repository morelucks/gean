# gean

A Go consensus client for Lean Ethereum, built around the idea that protocol simplicity is a security property.

## Philosophy

A consensus client should be something a developer can read, understand, and verify without needing to trust a small class of experts. If you can't inspect it end-to-end, it's not fully yours.

## What is Lean Consensus

A complete redesign of Ethereum's consensus layer, hardened for security, decentralization, and finality in seconds.


## Design approach

- **Readable over clever.** Code is written so that someone unfamiliar with the codebase can follow it. Naming is explicit. Control flow is linear where possible.
- **Minimal dependencies.** Fewer imports means fewer things that can break, fewer things to audit, and fewer things to understand.
- **No premature abstraction.** Interfaces and generics are introduced when the duplication is real, not when it's hypothetical. Concrete types until proven otherwise.
- **Flat and direct.** Avoid deep package hierarchies and layers of indirection. A function should do what its name says, and you should be able to find it quickly.
- **Concurrency only where necessary.** Go makes concurrency easy to write and hard to reason about. We use it at the boundaries (networking, event loops) and keep the core logic sequential and deterministic.

## Current status

| Devnet | Status | Spec pin |
|--------|--------|----------|
| pq-devnet-0 | Complete | `leanSpec@4b750f2` |
| pq-devnet-1 | In progress | `leanSpec@050fa4a`, `leanSig@f10dcbe` |

devnet-1 progress:
- Done: consensus envelope pipeline (`SignedAttestation`, `SignedBlockWithAttestation`, proposer-attestation ordering, signed storage/sync path)
- Next: XMSS/leanSig integration (CGo bindings, key management, signing, verification), then cross-client interop

## Getting started

```sh
# Build
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Lint
make lint

# Generate keys
./bin/keygen -validators 5 -keys-dir keys -print-yaml

# Run
make run
```

## Running in a devnet

gean is part of the [lean-quickstart](https://github.com/blockblaz/lean-quickstart) multi-client devnet tooling (integration in progress for devnet-1).
